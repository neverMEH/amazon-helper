# Authentication Options for AMC Manager with Supabase

## Option 1: Continue with Amazon OAuth + Custom JWT
**Current Setup** - Keep your existing Amazon OAuth flow

### Implementation:
1. User logs in with Amazon Advertising credentials
2. Generate JWT token with user ID
3. Pass user ID to Supabase queries
4. RLS policies use the user ID for access control

### Pros:
- No changes to existing auth flow
- Users authenticate with Amazon directly
- Maintains single sign-on with Amazon Ads

### Cons:
- Need to manage JWT tokens yourself
- RLS policies need modification to use custom user IDs

### Code Changes Needed:
```python
# In RLS policies, replace:
auth.uid() = user_id

# With:
user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id')::uuid
```

## Option 2: Supabase Auth with Amazon OAuth Provider
**Recommended** - Use Supabase Auth with custom Amazon provider

### Implementation:
1. Configure Amazon as OAuth provider in Supabase
2. Users authenticate through Supabase
3. Supabase manages sessions and tokens
4. RLS policies work out of the box

### Pros:
- Built-in session management
- RLS policies work without modification
- Additional auth methods available (email/password, magic links)
- Automatic token refresh

### Cons:
- Need to set up Amazon as custom OAuth provider
- Users might need to re-authenticate

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Most Flexible** - Amazon OAuth for API access, Supabase for data access

### Implementation:
1. Amazon OAuth for advertising API calls
2. Create Supabase user on first Amazon login
3. Use Supabase sessions for database access
4. Store Amazon tokens encrypted in user profile

### Pros:
- Best of both worlds
- Can add additional auth methods later
- Secure token storage

### Cons:
- More complex implementation
- Need to sync user accounts

## Recommendation
Start with **Option 1** (keep existing auth) for fastest migration, then gradually move to **Option 3** (hybrid) for better security and features.
