# dsp_views Data Source Schema

## Overview

**Data Source:** `dsp_views`

Represents all view events and all measurable events. Measurable events are from impression that were able to be measured. Viewable events represent events that met a viewable standard. The metric viewable_impressions is the count of viewable impressions using the IAB standard (50% of the impression's pixels were on screen for at least 1 second). 

**Important Note:** The dsp_views table records a single impression more than one time if it is both measurable and viewable according to IAB's standards. An impression that is both measurable and viewable according to IAB's standards is recorded in one row as a measurable event and in another row as a viewable event. Note that while all impression events from dsp_views are recorded in dsp_impressions, not all impression events from dsp_impressions are recorded in dsp_views because not all impression events can be categorized as viewable, measurable or unmeasurable.

| event_type | STRING | Dimension | Type of view event. There are four types of view events in AMC. Measurable impression events indicate that the Amazon Ads impression was able to be measured for viewability; these events can be summed using the measurable_impressions metric. Viewable impression events indicate Amazon Ads determined the impression met MRC viewability standards; these events can be summed using the viewable_impressions metric. Unmeasurable viewable and synthetic viewable impression events are estimated to be viewable; these events can be summed using the unmeasurable_viewable_impressions metric. Possible values include: 'MEASURABLE_IMP' (measurable impression), 'VIEW' (viewable impression), 'UNMEASURABLE_IMP' (unmeasurable viewable impression), and 'SYNTHETIC_VIEW' (synthetic view impression). | LOW |
| events | LONG | Metric | Count of Amazon DSP view events. When querying this table, remember that each record represents one Amazon DSP view event, and a single impression may have more than one view event. Therefore, this field will not represent the exact count of impressions served by your campaigns. Since this table only includes views events, this field will always have a value of '1' (the event was a view event). | NONE |
| impression_id | STRING | Dimension | ID that connects related impression, view, click, and conversion events. For example, if an impression served has a request_tag value of 'X', related view events will have have an impression_id value of 'X'. All view events for a single impression will share a common impression_id value. While this occurs infrequently, there are sometimes duplicate request_tag values. As a result, it is not recommended to use request_tag as a JOIN key without first grouping by it. Rather, it is a best practice to first consider using UNION ALL in a query instead of joining based on the request_tag to combine data sources. For insights that involve user-level ad exposure across tables, use user_id instead. | VERY_HIGH |
| line_item | STRING | Dimension | Name of the Amazon DSP line item responsible for the view event. Attributes like ad format and targeting are defined at line item level within a campaign. Example value: 'Widgets - DISPLAY - O&O - RETARGETING'. | LOW |

| line_item_end_dt_utc | TIMESTAMP | Dimension | End date and time of the line item in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Example value: '2025-01-01T23:59:59.000Z'. | LOW |
| line_item_id | LONG | Dimension | ID of the Amazon DSP line item responsible for the view event. Attributes like ad format and targeting are defined at line item level within a campaign. Example value: '5812345678901234'. | LOW |
| line_item_price_type | STRING | Dimension | Pricing model used for the Amazon DSP line item. Line items can use different pricing models to determine how costs are calculated, with Cost Per Mille (CPM) being a common model where advertisers pay per thousand impressions. Example value: 'CPM'. | LOW |
| line_item_start_dt | TIMESTAMP | Dimension | Start date and time of the Amazon DSP line item in advertiser timezone. Example value: '2025-01-01T23:59:59.000Z'. | LOW |

| line_item_type | STRING | Dimension | Type of Amazon DSP line item. Line item types indicate how ads are delivered and optimized. Example values include: 'AAP', 'AAP_DISPLAY', 'AAP_MOBILE', 'AAP_VIDEO_CPM'. | LOW |
| manager_account_frequency_group_ids | ARRAY | Dimension | An array of the manager-account-level frequency group IDs that were applicable for this impression event. Frequency groups created at the manager account level may operate across 1 or more advertisers within that manager account. Note that a single impression may be subject to multiple frequency groups. | LOW |
| measurable_impressions | LONG | Metric | Count of impressions that could be measured for viewability. Measurable impression events indicate that the Amazon Ads impression was able to be measured for viewability. A single impression that is measurable could also be viewable, but not all measurable impressions are viewable. If an impression is both measurable and viewable, each event for the single impression is listed as a separate row. Possible values for this field are: '1' (if the record represents a measurable impression) or '0' (if the record does not represent a measurable impression). | NONE |
| merchant_id | LONG | Dimension | Merchant ID. | LOW |
| no_3p_trackers | STRING | Dimension | Boolean value indicating whether the event can be used for audience creation that is third-party tracking enabled (i.e. whether you can serve creative with third-party tracking when running media against the audience). Third-party tracking refers to measurement tags and pixels from external vendors that can be used to measure ad performance. Possible values for this field are: 'true', 'false'. | NONE |

| site | STRING | Dimension | The site descriptor where the Amazon DSP view event occurred. A site can be any digital property where ads are served, including websites, mobile apps, and streaming platforms. | LOW |
| slot_position | STRING | Dimension | Position of the ad on the page relative to the initial viewport. Above the fold (ATF) refers to the portion of the webpage visible without scrolling, while below the fold (BTF) refers to the portion that requires scrolling to view. This dimension helps measure where ad impressions were served on the page. Possible values include: 'ATF', 'BTF', and 'UNKNOWN'. | LOW |
| supply_source_id | LONG | Dimension | ID of the supply source from which the Amazon DSP impression was purchased. Supply sources can include Amazon-owned properties (like Amazon.com and Twitch), Amazon Publisher Services inventory, and third-party partners. | LOW |
| unmeasurable_viewable_impressions | LONG | Metric | Count of unmeasurable viewable/synthetic view events. Unmeasurable viewable and synthetic viewable events are estimated to be viewable, but could not be measured for viewability. Possible values for this field are: '1' (if the record represents a unmeasurable viewable/synthetic view event) or '0' (if the record does not represent a unmeasurable viewable/synthetic view event). | NONE |
| user_id | STRING | Dimension | Pseudonymous identifier that connects user activity across different events. The field can contain ad user IDs (representing Amazon accounts), device IDs, or browser IDs. NULL values appear when Amazon Ads is unable to resolve an identifier for an event. The field has a VERY_HIGH aggregation threshold, meaning it cannot be included in final SELECT statements but can be used within Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for aggregation purposes like COUNT(DISTINCT user_id). | VERY_HIGH |
| user_id_type | STRING | Dimension | Type of user ID value. AMC includes different types of user ID values, depending on whether the value represents a resolved Amazon account, a device, or a browser cookie. If Amazon Ads is unable to determine or provide an ID of any kind for a view event, the 'user_id' and 'user_id_type' values for that record will be NULL. Possible values include: 'adUserId', 'sisDeviceId', 'adBrowserId', and NULL. | LOW |
| view_definition | STRING | Dimension | Type of viewability measurement definition used to classify the view event. This field will only be populated for viewable impressions (event_type = 'VIEW'). | LOW |
| viewable_impressions | LONG | Metric | The count of impressions that were considered viewable. An impression is considered viewable when at least 50% of the ad's pixels are in view for at least one continuous second for display ads, or two continuous seconds for video ads. This is the Media Rating Council's (MRC) definition of viewability. Note that a single impression that is viewable has two events: a viewable impression and a measurable impression. Each event for the single impression is listed as a separate row. Possible values for this field are: '1' (if the record represents a viewable impression) or '0' (if the record does not represent a viewable impression). | NONE |

## Key Concepts and Unique Features

### Event Types
The `event_type` field is crucial for understanding this table:
- **MEASURABLE_IMP**: Measurable impression - could be measured for viewability
- **VIEW**: Viewable impression - met MRC viewability standards  
- **UNMEASURABLE_IMP**: Unmeasurable viewable impression - estimated to be viewable
- **SYNTHETIC_VIEW**: Synthetic view impression - estimated to be viewable

### Important Metrics
- **viewable_impressions**: Count of impressions meeting MRC viewability standards (50% pixels visible for 1+ seconds for display, 2+ seconds for video)
- **measurable_impressions**: Count of impressions that could be measured for viewability
- **unmeasurable_viewable_impressions**: Count of impressions estimated to be viewable but couldn't be measured
- **events**: Always '1' since each record represents one view event

### Data Structure Notes
- **Single impression, multiple records**: An impression that is both measurable and viewable will appear as TWO separate rows
- **Not all impressions included**: Only impressions that can be categorized as viewable, measurable, or unmeasurable are included
- **Relationship to dsp_impressions**: All events in dsp_views are in dsp_impressions, but not vice versa

## Aggregation Threshold Notes

- **NONE**: No aggregation threshold restrictions
- **LOW**: Standard low threshold applies
- **MEDIUM**: Medium aggregation threshold - use caution in small segments
- **HIGH**: High aggregation threshold - significant restrictions on granular queries
- **VERY_HIGH**: Very high threshold - cannot be included in final SELECT statements but can be used in CTEs for aggregation
