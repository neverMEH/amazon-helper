# Campaign Import Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented campaign import functionality for the Amazon Helper application using Supabase as the backend. The feature allows importing and managing campaigns from Amazon Advertising API with brand tagging and ASIN tracking.

## Completed Components

### 1. Campaign Service (`amc_manager/services/campaign_service.py`)
- Fetches campaigns from Amazon API (DSP, SP, SD, SB)
- Auto-tags campaigns with brand names based on patterns
- Stores campaign data with ASIN associations
- Handles multiple marketplace and profile IDs

### 2. Database Schema
- `campaign_mappings` table with:
  - BIGINT campaign_id (Amazon's numeric IDs)
  - Brand tagging support
  - ASIN array tracking
  - User association for data isolation
  - Campaign type classification (DSP/SP/SD/SB)

### 3. API Endpoints (`/api/campaigns/*`)
- `GET /api/campaigns` - List all campaigns with filtering
  - Filter by brand_tag: `?brand_tag=dirty labs`
  - Filter by type: `?campaign_type=DSP`
- `POST /api/campaigns/sync` - Sync campaigns from Amazon API
- `PUT /api/campaigns/{id}` - Update campaign details

### 4. Test Scripts
- `scripts/import_campaigns.py` - Import real campaigns from Amazon API
- `scripts/test_campaign_import_mock.py` - Test with mock data
- `scripts/test_campaign_endpoints.py` - Test API endpoints

## Sample Data Created
Created 8 mock campaigns across 4 types:
- 2 DSP campaigns (Dirty Labs, Planetary Design)
- 2 SP campaigns (Supergoop, OOFOS)
- 2 SD campaigns (Dr Brandt, Drunk Elephant)
- 2 SB campaigns (Nest New York, Beekman)

## Technical Notes

### Campaign ID Format
- Amazon uses numeric IDs (BIGINT)
- Example: 123450001 for DSP campaigns
- Not string IDs like "DSP-12345"

### Brand Auto-Tagging
The system automatically detects brands from campaign names:
```python
brand_patterns = {
    'dirty labs': ['dirty labs', 'dirtylabs'],
    'planetary design': ['planetary', 'planetary design'],
    'supergoop': ['supergoop'],
    # ... more patterns
}
```

### API Authentication
Uses JWT tokens for API authentication:
```python
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
```

## Usage Examples

### Import Campaigns (with real tokens)
```bash
python scripts/import_campaigns.py --email nick@nevermeh.com
```

### Test with Mock Data
```bash
python scripts/test_campaign_import_mock.py
```

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
python scripts/test_campaign_endpoints.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Implement real token validation with Amazon OAuth
2. Add campaign performance metrics
3. Build workflow execution for AMC queries
4. Create campaign analytics dashboard

## Dependencies
- Supabase for database
- FastAPI for REST API
- JWT for authentication
- No SQLAlchemy/Redis/Celery needed
