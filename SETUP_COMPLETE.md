## Next Steps for AMC Access

### 1. **Check AMC Instance Availability**
AMC instances are provisioned separately from regular advertising accounts. You'll need to:
- Contact your Amazon Advertising account manager
- Request AMC instance access for your accounts
- Get the AMC instance IDs once provisioned

### 2. **Complete Application Setup**
```bash
# Install all dependencies
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up PostgreSQL database
# Update DATABASE_URL in .env with your actual database

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the full application
python main.py
```

### 3. **Use the Application**
Once running, you can:
- Access API docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Use the saved tokens for API calls
- Select which profile to use for queries
- Build and execute AMC queries

### 4. **API Integration Example**
```python
# Example: Using the API with your tokens
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    'Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId': 'amzn1.application-oa2-client.cf1789da23f74ee489e2373e424726af',
    'Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope': '149933231819265',  # Dirty Labs US profile
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

# Make API calls...
```

## Important Notes

1. **Token Expiration**: Your access token expires in 1 hour. Use the refresh token to get new access tokens.

2. **AMC vs Regular API**: AMC requires separate instance provisioning. The API credentials work, but you need AMC instances assigned to your accounts.

3. **Rate Limits**: The application has built-in rate limiting to respect Amazon's API limits.

4. **Security**: Never commit your tokens or credentials to version control.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that your tokens haven't expired
2. Verify the profile ID you're using has the necessary permissions
3. Ensure AMC instances are provisioned for your account
4. Check the server logs for detailed error messages

## Support

- Contact your Amazon Advertising account manager

- Check the Advanced Tools Center in your Amazon Ads console

**Your authentication is working perfectly! üéâ**

The main thing you need now is to have AMC instances provisioned for your advertising accounts. Once you have the instance IDs, the application is ready to manage them.
