## Key Discovery: AMC API Authentication

**CRITICAL**: The AMC instances API requires the entity ID to be passed as the `Amazon-Advertising-API-AdvertiserId` header, NOT as a query parameter. This was a major breakthrough that solved the "entityId provided is null" errors.

Correct header format:
```python
headers = {
    'Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId': CLIENT_ID,
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
    'Amazon-Advertising-API-MarketplaceId': marketplace_id,
    'Amazon-Advertising-API-AdvertiserId': entity_id  # This is the key!
}
```

## Architecture and Code Structure

### Core Components

1. **Authentication Flow** (`amc_manager/core/auth.py`)
   - OAuth 2.0 with Login with Amazon (LWA)
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - User profile retrieval and entity discovery

2. **API Client** (`amc_manager/core/api_client.py`)
   - Rate limiting with retry logic
   - Custom headers support (critical for AMC API)
   - Automatic token refresh on 401 errors

3. **Supabase Integration** (`amc_manager/core/supabase_client.py`)
   - Singleton client manager
   - Service role support for admin operations
   - Base service class for all Supabase operations

4. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - `SupabaseService`: Base class for all services
   - `CampaignMappingService`: Manages campaign data with ASIN tracking
   - `BrandConfigurationService`: Brand settings and auto-tagging
   - `WorkflowService`: AMC workflow management
   - `AMCInstanceService`: Instance access and validation

5. **Query Builder** (`amc_manager/services/query_builder.py`)
   - Pre-built templates for common analyses
   - YAML parameter support for dynamic queries
   - SQL validation and safety checks

### Key Files and Their Purposes

**Backend**:
- `main_supabase.py`: Main FastAPI application entry point (port 8001)
- `amc_manager/config/settings.py`: Configuration management using Pydantic
- `amc_manager/core/supabase_client.py`: Supabase client singleton manager
- `amc_manager/services/db_service.py`: Database service with retry logic
- `amc_manager/api/supabase/`: API endpoints using Supabase
  - `auth.py`: Authentication endpoints
  - `instances_simple.py`: AMC instances endpoints
  - `campaigns.py`: Campaign management endpoints
  - `workflows.py`: Workflow management endpoints
  - `queries.py`: Query template endpoints

**Frontend** (`frontend/`):
- `src/App.tsx`: Main React application with routing
- `src/components/auth/`: Authentication components
- `src/components/instances/`: Instance list and detail components
- `src/components/campaigns/`: Campaign management UI
- `src/components/workflows/`: Workflow management UI
- `src/services/api.ts`: Axios API client configuration
- `src/services/auth.ts`: Authentication service
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration with API proxy

### Database Schema (Supabase)

All tables are created in Supabase with RLS enabled:
- `users`: User accounts with profile and marketplace IDs
- `amc_accounts`: AMC account entities (2 imported)
- `amc_instances`: AMC instance configurations (58 imported)
- `workflows`: AMC workflow definitions with SQL queries
- `workflow_executions`: Execution history and status tracking
- `campaign_mappings`: Campaign ID to name mappings with ASIN tracking
- `brand_configurations`: Brand settings with ASIN associations
- `query_templates`: Reusable query templates (3 created)
- `workflow_schedules`: CRON-based scheduling
- `amc_query_results`: Query result caching

### AMC Instance Details

The application manages 58 AMC instances across two accounts:
- **Recommerce Brands** (ENTITYEJZCBSCBH4HZ): 50 instances
- **NeverMeh AMC** (ENTITY277TBI8OBF435): 8 instances

Each account has one SANDBOX instance for testing.

### Common AMC SQL Query Templates

The system includes templates for:
- Path to Conversion Analysis
- New-to-Brand Customer Analysis
- Cart Abandonment Analysis
- Cross-Channel Performance
- Attribution Model Comparison
- Audience Overlap Analysis
- Campaign Reach & Frequency

### API Integration Notes

1. Always use `https://advertising-api.amazon.com` as the base URL
2. Include marketplace ID in headers (US: ATVPDKIKX0DER)
3. Rate limits: 10 requests per second (handled automatically)
4. Token expiration: 1 hour (auto-refresh implemented)

### Testing Approach

- Use sandbox instances (`amchnfozgta` or `amcfo8abayq`) for development
- Test scripts available in root directory (e.g., `amc_instances_working.py`)
- Integration tests should mock external API calls

### Environment Variables

Critical variables that must be set:
- `AMAZON_CLIENT_ID`: From Amazon Advertising console
- `AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET`: Keep secure, never commit
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public anon key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Service role key for admin operations
- `DATABASE_URL`: Optional - for SQLAlchemy compatibility
- `REDIS_URL`: Optional - if using Celery instead of Edge Functions
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: Optional - Supabase Storage can be used instead

### Debugging Tips

1. For AMC API errors, check headers first (especially `Amazon-Advertising-API-AdvertiserId`)
2. Token refresh issues: Check token expiration and refresh token validity
3. Supabase connection issues: Verify project URL and keys in .env
4. For 403 errors: Verify the user has access to the requested AMC instance
5. RLS errors: Check that user ID matches in requests
6. Data not showing after idle period: 
   - Supabase connection times out after ~30 minutes
   - Automatic reconnection implemented in `db_service.py`
   - Frontend will refetch on window focus
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) if needed
7. JWT errors: Fixed by using `jwt.DecodeError` instead of `jwt.JWTError`

### Important Scripts

- `test_supabase_simple.py`: Quick Supabase connection test
- `scripts/import_initial_data.py`: Import user, accounts, and instances
- `scripts/create_sample_workflow.py`: Create template workflows
- `scripts/test_auth_flow.py`: Test Amazon OAuth tokens
- `scripts/test_campaign_import_mock.py`: Import mock campaign data with brands
- `scripts/test_instance_brands.py`: Test instance brand functionality
- `scripts/apply_instance_brands_migration.py`: Apply database migration for brands
- `scripts/apply_performance_indexes.py`: Apply performance optimization indexes
- `start_services.sh`: Start both backend and frontend services
- `prepare_railway.sh`: Prepare app for Railway deployment
- `test_execution.py`: Test workflow execution functionality
- `test_execution_detail.py`: Test execution detail viewing
- `demo_execution.py`: Demonstrate execution success/failure scenarios

### Performance Optimization Steps

To apply the performance optimizations:
1. Run the index migration: `python scripts/apply_performance_indexes.py`
2. Restart the backend service to use the new optimized queries
3. The frontend will automatically benefit from faster API responses

### Security Considerations

- All tokens are encrypted in the database using Fernet encryption
- API endpoints require authentication via JWT
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Never log or expose client secrets or tokens
- Frontend stores JWT in localStorage (consider moving to httpOnly cookies for production)
