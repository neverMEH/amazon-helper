# 2025-09-25 Recap: AI-Powered Charts & Insights

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-25-ai-powered-charts/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented Phase 1 foundation for AI-Powered Charts & Insights, establishing the core AI infrastructure and data analysis capabilities. The implementation provides a robust foundation for transforming RecomAMP's execution details popup into an AI-powered analytics dashboard with automated data analysis, trend detection, and insight generation capabilities.

Key accomplishments:
- Built comprehensive AI Service Foundation with multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Implemented advanced Data Analysis AI Module with statistical analysis, trend detection, and anomaly detection
- Created robust testing infrastructure with comprehensive test suites for all AI components
- Established performance optimization with intelligent data sampling and caching mechanisms
- Documented the AI architecture with detailed API and technical specifications

## Context

Transform RecomAMP's execution details popup into an AI-powered analytics dashboard that automatically analyzes AMC data, recommends optimal chart visualizations, generates contextual insights about trends and anomalies, and provides an interactive chat interface for natural language data exploration. This enhancement will reduce time-to-insight from hours to minutes while enabling agencies to deliver more sophisticated analysis to clients without requiring data science expertise.
