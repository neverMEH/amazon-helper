# Report Builder Dashboards - Database Foundation Implementation Recap

**Date:** September 23, 2025
**Spec:** `.agent-os/specs/2025-09-23-report-builder-dashboards`
**Branch:** `report-builder-adhoc-execution`

## Overview

Successfully completed Phase 1 of the Report Builder Dashboards implementation, establishing the complete database foundation and infrastructure needed to enable AMC queries to generate interactive visual dashboards with charts, graphs, and AI-powered insights. The implementation transforms raw AMC execution data into comprehensive reports with automated historical data collection and PDF export capabilities.

## Completed Features Summary

### 1. Database Schema Implementation ✅

**Four New Core Tables Created:**
- **`report_configurations`** - Central configuration table linking workflows/templates to report settings
- **`dashboard_views`** - Stores dashboard view definitions with chart configurations and processed data
- **`dashboard_insights`** - AI-generated insights with confidence scoring and source tracking
- **`report_exports`** - Export file tracking with status and expiration management

**Extended Existing Tables:**
- **`workflows`** table: Added `report_enabled` and `report_config_id` columns
- **`query_templates`** table: Added `default_dashboard_type` column

### 2. Database Performance Optimization ✅

**Comprehensive Indexing Strategy:**
- 14+ indexes created for optimal query performance
- Composite indexes for multi-column filtering
- Conditional indexes for selective scanning
- Time-based indexes for chronological data access

**Key Performance Indexes:**
- Report configurations by workflow and template
- Dashboard views by configuration and type
- Insights by confidence score and generation date
- Exports by user and status

### 3. Security & Access Control ✅

**Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation:**
- Complete RLS policies for all new tables
- User-based access control through workflow/template ownership
- Cascading permissions from parent entities
- Secure export access limited to owners

### 4. Data Integrity & Constraints ✅

**Business Logic Enforcement:**
- Dashboard type constraints (funnel, performance, attribution, audience, custom)
- Insight type validation (trend, anomaly, recommendation, summary, comparison)
- Export format validation (pdf, png, csv, excel)
- Status transition controls for exports and processing

### 5. Migration Scripts & Automation ✅

**Production-Ready Migration System:**
- `apply_report_builder_dashboards_migration.py` - Main migration script
- `execute_report_builder_dashboards_migration.py` - Execution wrapper
- Comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities
- Migration verification with success/failure reporting

### 6. Test Coverage Implementation ✅

**Comprehensive Test Suite:**
- **Schema validation tests** - Verify table structures and constraints
- **Service layer tests** - Business logic validation
- **API endpoint tests** - Request/response validation
- **Integration tests** - End-to-end functionality
- **Performance tests** - Query optimization validation

**Test Files Created:**
- `test_report_builder_schema.py` - 405 lines of schema validation
- `test_report_service.py` - Service layer unit tests
- `test_report_api.py` - API integration tests

### 7. Automated Triggers & Functions ✅

**Database Automation:**
- `updated_at` timestamp triggers for configuration tracking
- Automatic UUID generation for all new entities
- Foreign key cascade handling for clean deletions

## Technical Architecture Details

### Report Configuration System
```sql
-- Core configuration linking workflows to reports
report_configurations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id UUID REFERENCES workflows(id),
    query_template_id UUID REFERENCES query_templates(id),
    dashboard_type VARCHAR(50),
    visualization_settings JSONB,
    data_aggregation_settings JSONB,
    export_settings JSONB,
    is_enabled BOOLEAN
)
```

### Dashboard Views Architecture
```sql
-- Flexible dashboard view system
dashboard_views (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    report_configuration_id UUID REFERENCES report_configurations(id),
    view_type VARCHAR(50) CHECK (view_type IN ('chart', 'table', 'metric_card', 'insight')),
    chart_configurations JSONB,
    filter_settings JSONB,
    layout_settings JSONB,
    processed_data JSONB
)
```

### AI Insights Integration
```sql
-- AI-powered insights with confidence tracking
dashboard_insights (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    dashboard_view_id UUID REFERENCES dashboard_views(id),
    insight_type VARCHAR(50),
    insight_text TEXT,
    confidence_score DECIMAL(3, 2),
    source_data JSONB,
    ai_model VARCHAR(100),
    prompt_version VARCHAR(20)
)
```
