# 2025-09-25 Recap: Query Template Fixes

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-25-query-template-fixes/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented critical fixes to the Query Library Template system, resolving three major integration and UX issues. The implementation properly connected the existing CampaignSelector component to replace basic text inputs, implemented persistent template name visibility across all editor tabs, integrated the full Query Library template collection with Report Builder, and enhanced parameter input components with specialized validation and visual indicators.

Key accomplishments:
- Fixed CampaignSelector integration in TemplateEditor with proper campaign selection, brand filtering, and error handling
- Implemented persistent template name header that remains visible across all tabs with auto-save functionality
- Fixed parameter state persistence issues ensuring all parameter properties are maintained through save operations
- Integrated Query Library with Report Builder including template selection modal and "Save as Template" feature
- Created enhanced parameter input components with type-specific validation and visual indicators for required fields

## Context

Fix critical Query Library Template integration issues by properly connecting the existing CampaignSelector component for campaign parameters, implementing persistent template name visibility across all editor tabs, and integrating templates with Report Builder. These fixes will restore broken functionality where campaign selection uses basic text input instead of the sophisticated multi-select dropdown, resolve UX issues where template names disappear when switching tabs, and enable Report Builder users to access the full Query Library template collection.
