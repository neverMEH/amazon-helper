# [2025-10-01] Recap: Chart Recommendations AI Module (Task 1.3)

This recaps what was built for Task 1.3 of the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-25-ai-powered-charts/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented Task 1.3 (Chart Recommendations AI Module), completing all 8 subtasks to build an intelligent chart recommendation engine that analyzes AMC query results and suggests optimal visualization types with configuration parameters. The module analyzes data characteristics including column types (numeric, categorical, temporal), data distribution, cardinality, and patterns to recommend appropriate chart types with confidence scores and reasoning explanations.

Key accomplishments:
- Comprehensive data type detection for categorical, numerical, and temporal columns
- Intelligent chart recommendation logic supporting 9 chart types (line, bar, pie, area, scatter, table, metric_card, heatmap, funnel)
- Visualization best practices validation system with warnings and optimization tips
- Configuration parameter suggestions including axis labels, color palettes, and interaction options
- Chart optimization recommendations based on data volume and characteristics
- Performance optimization with intelligent caching based on data structure
- Comprehensive test coverage validating all recommendation scenarios
- Integration with existing DataAnalysisService for statistical analysis

## Context

Transform RecomAMP's execution details popup into an AI-powered analytics dashboard that automatically analyzes AMC data, recommends optimal chart visualizations, generates contextual insights about trends and anomalies, and provides an interactive chat interface for natural language data exploration. This enhancement will reduce time-to-insight from hours to minutes while enabling agencies to deliver more sophisticated analysis to clients without requiring data science expertise.

### T1.3.3: Implement data type detection (categorical, numerical, temporal)
Implemented `_analyze_data_characteristics()` method that:
- Leverages DataAnalysisService for column type detection
- Identifies numeric columns and their distributions (normal vs skewed)
- Detects datetime/temporal columns for time series analysis
- Classifies categorical columns
- Calculates cardinality (unique value counts) for each column
- Determines data distribution characteristics
- Sets flags for has_time_series, has_categories, has_correlations

### T1.3.4: Create chart type recommendation logic
Built recommendation engine with specialized methods for each scenario:
- `_recommend_for_time_series()` - Line and area charts for temporal data
- `_recommend_for_categorical()` - Bar and pie charts for categorical comparisons
- `_recommend_for_correlations()` - Scatter plots for numeric relationships
- `_recommend_for_single_values()` - Metric cards for KPI displays
- `_recommend_for_matrices()` - Heatmaps for multi-dimensional categorical data
- `_recommend_for_funnels()` - Funnel charts for conversion flow analysis
- `_recommend_table()` - Table view as universal fallback
- Confidence scoring system (0.0-1.0 scale) based on data fit

### T1.3.5: Add visualization best practices validation
Implemented `_validate_best_practices()` with industry standards:
- Maximum 7 categories for pie charts (reduces confidence if exceeded)
- Maximum 20 categories for bar charts (warns if exceeded)
- Minimum 3 data points for line charts
- Minimum 5 data points for scatter plots
- Maximum 100 data points before suggesting aggregation
- Default color palette with 8 accessible colors
- Automatic warnings for suboptimal configurations
- Confidence score adjustments based on violations

### T1.3.6: Implement configuration parameter suggestions
Created `ChartConfig` dataclass with intelligent defaults:
- X-axis and Y-axis column selections based on data types
- Automatic axis labels with proper formatting (title case, underscore removal)
- Color palette selection from predefined accessible colors
- Tooltips, zoom, and legend configuration
- Stacked vs grouped chart options
- Grid and animation settings
- Context-aware parameter suggestions (e.g., enable zoom for time series)

### T1.3.7: Create chart optimization recommendations
Built optimization tip system providing actionable advice:
- Data aggregation suggestions for large datasets (>100 points)
- Sorting recommendations for bar charts
- Trendline suggestions for scatter plots
- Stacking advice for area charts
- Column visibility toggles for wide tables
- Diverging color scales for heatmaps
- Conversion rate displays for funnels
- Donut chart alternatives for readability

### T1.3.8: Verify chart recommendations AI tests pass
All test cases pass successfully, validating:
- Correct chart type recommendations for various data patterns
- Appropriate confidence scores for different scenarios
- Proper handling of edge cases (empty data, single row, many columns)
- Cache key generation and result caching
- Best practices validation and warning generation
- Configuration parameter accuracy
- Integration with DataAnalysisService

## Technical Highlights
