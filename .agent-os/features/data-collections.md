### Fixed Collection Execution ID Mapping Issue
**Problem**: The collection progress view was experiencing 404 errors when users tried to view individual week executions. The issue was caused by passing UUID database IDs to the AMC API instead of the actual AMC execution IDs.

**Root Cause**: 
- `report_data_weeks` table stores `workflow_execution_id` (UUID reference to `workflow_executions.id`)
- AMC API endpoints expect the actual AMC execution ID string (e.g., "20241010-abc123-def456")
- The frontend was passing the UUID directly to AMC API routes, causing 404 responses

**Solution**: Updated `historical_collection_service.py` in the `get_collection_progress` method:

1. **Primary Fix**: Use `amc_execution_id` from `report_data_weeks` table when available
2. **Fallback Logic**: When only `workflow_execution_id` (UUID) exists, look up the actual AMC execution ID from the `workflow_executions` table
3. **ID Mapping**: Map the correct execution ID to the `execution_id` field for frontend consumption

**Files Modified**:
- `/amc_manager/services/historical_collection_service.py` - Added execution ID mapping logic
- `/amc_manager/config/settings.py` - Added `extra = 'ignore'` to allow additional environment variables

**Impact**: 
- Users can now successfully view individual week execution details from collection progress screens
- Resolves 404 errors when clicking on week execution entries
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing collection data
- No database schema changes required

## Key Components

### Backend Services
- `amc_manager/services/data_collection_service.py` - Main collection management
- `amc_manager/services/collection_executor.py` - Background execution service
- `amc_manager/api/supabase/data_collections.py` - API endpoints

### Frontend Components
- `frontend/src/pages/DataCollections.tsx` - Collections list view
- `frontend/src/components/DataCollectionForm.tsx` - Collection creation form
- `frontend/src/components/DataCollectionProgress.tsx` - Progress tracking
- `frontend/src/components/CollectionExecutionModal.tsx` - Week execution details

### Database Tables
- `report_data_collections` - Collection configurations
- `report_data_weeks` - Individual week tracking
- `workflow_executions` - Actual execution records (joined)

## Technical Implementation

### Collection Creation
```python
# DataCollectionService.create_collection
async def create_collection(self, collection_data: dict):
    # 1. Create collection record
    collection = self.db.table('report_data_collections').insert({
        'name': collection_data['name'],
        'workflow_id': collection_data['workflow_id'],
        'instance_id': collection_data['instance_id'],  # UUID FK
        'start_date': collection_data['start_date'],
        'end_date': collection_data['end_date'],
        'status': 'ACTIVE'
    }).execute()
    
    # 2. Generate week records
    weeks = self._generate_week_periods(start_date, end_date)
    for week in weeks:
        self.db.table('report_data_weeks').insert({
            'collection_id': collection.data[0]['id'],
            'week_start_date': week['start'],
            'week_end_date': week['end'],
            'status': 'PENDING'
        }).execute()
```

### Parallel Execution Strategy
- **Collection Concurrency**: Max 5 collections running simultaneously
- **Week Concurrency**: Max 10 weeks per collection in parallel
- **Instance Throttling**: Respects AMC rate limits per instance

### Collection Executor Service
```python
# collection_executor.py - Background service
async def process_collections(self):
    active_collections = self.get_active_collections()
    
    for collection in active_collections:
        if self.can_process_collection(collection):
            await self.process_collection_weeks(collection)

async def process_collection_weeks(self, collection):
    pending_weeks = self.get_pending_weeks(collection['id'])
    
    # Process up to 10 weeks concurrently
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
    tasks = []
    
    for week in pending_weeks[:10]:
        task = self.execute_week_with_semaphore(semaphore, collection, week)
        tasks.append(task)
    
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

## Data Flow

1. **Collection Setup**: User creates collection with date range
2. **Week Generation**: System creates individual week records
3. **Background Processing**: Executor service processes pending weeks
4. **Workflow Execution**: Each week triggers a workflow execution
5. **Status Updates**: Real-time progress tracking
6. **Result Aggregation**: All week results available for analysis

## Week Processing Logic

### Date Period Calculation
```python
def generate_week_periods(self, start_date: date, end_date: date) -> List[dict]:
    weeks = []
    current = start_date
    
    while current <= end_date:
        week_start = current - timedelta(days=current.weekday())  # Monday
        week_end = week_start + timedelta(days=6)  # Sunday
        
        weeks.append({
            'start': week_start,
            'end': min(week_end, end_date)
        })
        
        current = week_end + timedelta(days=1)
    
    return weeks
```

### Parameter Substitution
Each week execution includes:
- `{{start_date}}` → Week start date
- `{{end_date}}` → Week end date
- Campaign/ASIN filters from collection config

## Critical Gotchas

### Instance ID Resolution
```python
# CRITICAL: Collections store UUID reference but AMC needs string ID
collection_data = self.db.table('report_data_collections')\
    .select('*, amc_instances(*)')\
    .eq('id', collection_id)\
    .execute()

# Use amc_instances.instance_id for API calls, not collections.instance_id (UUID)
instance_id = collection_data['amc_instances']['instance_id']  # String like "amcibersblt"
entity_id = collection_data['amc_instances']['amc_accounts']['account_id']
```

### Execution ID Mapping (Fixed 2025-09-10)
```python
# CRITICAL: Collections page was passing UUID database IDs to AMC API instead of AMC execution IDs
# Fixed in historical_collection_service.py get_collection_progress method

# Problem: report_data_weeks table stores workflow_execution_id (UUID) but AMC API needs amc_execution_id
for week in weeks:
    # Use amc_execution_id if available, otherwise use execution_id
    if 'amc_execution_id' in week and week['amc_execution_id']:
        week['execution_id'] = week['amc_execution_id']
    # If only workflow_execution_id exists (UUID), look it up in workflow_executions table
    elif 'workflow_execution_id' in week and week['workflow_execution_id']:
        exec_response = self.db.client.table('workflow_executions')\
            .select('execution_id, amc_execution_id')\
            .eq('id', week['workflow_execution_id'])\
            .execute()
        if exec_response.data and len(exec_response.data) > 0:
            exec_data = exec_response.data[0]
            # Prefer amc_execution_id, fallback to execution_id
            week['execution_id'] = exec_data.get('amc_execution_id') or exec_data.get('execution_id')
```

## Status Management

### Collection Status States
- `ACTIVE` - Collection is running
- `PAUSED` - Temporarily paused by user
- `COMPLETED` - All weeks finished successfully
- `FAILED` - Collection failed with errors

### Week Status States
- `PENDING` - Week not yet executed
- `RUNNING` - Execution in progress
- `SUCCESS` - Week completed successfully
- `FAILED` - Week execution failed
- `SKIPPED` - Week skipped due to filters

## Error Handling and Retries

### Automatic Retry Logic
```python
async def retry_failed_week(self, week_id: str):
    # Reset week status to PENDING
    self.db.table('report_data_weeks')\
        .update({'status': 'PENDING', 'error_message': None})\
        .eq('id', week_id)\
        .execute()
    
    # Will be picked up by next executor cycle
```

### Collection Recovery
- Individual week failures don't stop entire collection
- Failed weeks can be retried individually
- Collections can be paused and resumed

## Frontend Integration

### Progress Tracking
```typescript
// Real-time progress updates
const { data: collections } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['data-collections'],
  queryFn: () => dataCollectionService.list(),
  refetchInterval: 5000  // Update every 5 seconds
});

// Calculate progress percentage
const progress = {
  total: collection.total_weeks,
  completed: collection.completed_weeks,
  percentage: Math.round((collection.completed_weeks / collection.total_weeks) * 100)
};
```

### Week Execution Modal
```typescript
// View individual week executions
const openExecutionModal = (collection, week) => {
  // Fetch execution details for specific week
  // Show execution logs, results, timing
};
```

## Interconnections

### With Workflow System
- Each week creates a workflow execution
- Uses same parameter substitution system
- Inherits execution monitoring and results

### With Scheduling System
- Collections can be scheduled for regular updates
- Supports incremental data collection

### With Dashboard System
- Collection results feed into dashboard widgets
- Historical data enables trend analysis

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Processing
- Process multiple weeks concurrently
- Respect AMC API rate limits
- Efficient database queries for status updates

### Memory Management
- Stream large result sets
- Clean up completed execution data
- Optimize week record queries

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Collection Metrics
```sql
-- Track collection performance
SELECT 
  c.name,
  c.status,
  COUNT(w.id) as total_weeks,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN w.status = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1 END) as completed_weeks,
