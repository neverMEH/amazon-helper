> Last Updated: 2025-09-10
> Version: 2.0.0

## Pitch

RecomAMP is the agency-focused Amazon Marketing Cloud platform that transforms complex SQL analytics into actionable advertising insights. We eliminate the technical barriers that prevent marketing agencies from leveraging Amazon's most powerful data source, enabling teams to deliver sophisticated campaign analysis and optimization recommendations to their clients.

## Users

**Primary Users:**
- **Marketing Agency Analysts** (15-25 users): Execute AMC queries, build reports, analyze campaign performance
- **Agency Account Managers** (8-12 users): Access client dashboards, interpret results, present insights
- **Agency Data Scientists** (3-5 users): Build complex multi-step analytical workflows, develop custom attribution models
- **Agency Leadership** (2-3 users): High-level performance monitoring, client health dashboards

**User Hierarchy:**
- **Super Admins**: Platform managers with full system access
- **Admins**: Team managers who configure instances and manage user permissions  
- **Team Members**: Analysts who execute queries and build reports

**Scale:** Serving agencies managing 15+ AMC instances across multiple client accounts with 100+ active workflows.

## The Problem

Amazon Marketing Cloud provides unparalleled advertising data insights, but agencies struggle with:

1. **Technical Complexity**: AMC requires specialized SQL knowledge and understanding of complex schema relationships
2. **Time-Intensive Setup**: Manual query building, parameter management, and execution monitoring consumes analyst time
3. **Fragmented Workflow**: No centralized platform for managing multiple client AMC instances and coordinating team access
4. **Limited Automation**: Lack of scheduling, retry logic, and automated reporting capabilities
5. **Knowledge Silos**: AMC expertise concentrated in few team members, limiting scalability
6. **Client Reporting Gaps**: Difficulty translating technical AMC results into business-friendly client presentations

**Current State:** Agencies either avoid AMC entirely (missing critical insights) or invest significant technical resources with inconsistent results.

## Differentiators

**vs. Direct AMC Console:**
- Multi-instance management from single platform
- Advanced scheduling and automation capabilities
- Team collaboration and knowledge sharing features
- Guided query building with tactical use cases

**vs. Generic BI Tools (Tableau, Looker):**
- Native AMC schema integration and query optimization
- Understanding of Amazon advertising data nuances
- Pre-built templates for common agency use cases
- OAuth integration with Amazon APIs

**vs. Custom Internal Solutions:**
- Production-ready platform with enterprise features
- Continuous development and feature updates
- Built-in best practices and error handling
- No internal development or maintenance overhead

**Unique Value:** The only platform purpose-built for agency AMC workflows with deep understanding of both Amazon advertising ecosystem and agency operational needs.
