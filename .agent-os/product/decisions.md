## 2024-06-15: Database Architecture Decision

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, DevOps, Product Owner

### Decision

Use Supabase PostgreSQL as the primary database with Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenant data isolation.

### Context

RecomAMP requires secure multi-instance data isolation for agency clients while maintaining performance for complex AMC query operations. The platform needs real-time updates for execution status and supports concurrent users accessing different client data.

### Rationale

1. **Built-in Security**: RLS policies provide database-level tenant isolation
2. **Real-time Capabilities**: Native WebSocket subscriptions for live execution updates  
3. **Reduced Operational Overhead**: Managed PostgreSQL with automatic backups and scaling
4. **Developer Experience**: Instant REST APIs and TypeScript client generation
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Single database instance with logical separation vs. multiple databases

### Alternatives Considered

- **AWS RDS PostgreSQL**: Requires custom auth and real-time implementation
- **PlanetScale MySQL**: Excellent scaling but lacks advanced PostgreSQL features needed for AMC data analysis
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL flexibility but complex queries needed for AMC analytics favor relational data

### Implementation

- All tables include `user_id` foreign key for RLS policy enforcement
- AMC instances have explicit user ownership with sharing capabilities
- Background services use service role key to bypass RLS when necessary
- Query execution results isolated by instance ownership

## 2024-07-20: Authentication Strategy Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Security
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Security Review, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement OAuth 2.0 integration with Amazon Advertising API as the primary authentication method with encrypted token storage.

### Context

Agency users need secure access to multiple client AMC instances without repeatedly entering credentials. Amazon requires OAuth 2.0 for API access, and tokens must be refreshed automatically to maintain uninterrupted scheduled query execution.

### Rationale

1. **Amazon API Requirement**: OAuth 2.0 is mandatory for Amazon Advertising API access
2. **User Experience**: Single sign-on eliminates repeated credential entry
3. **Security**: Encrypted token storage prevents credential exposure
4. **Automation**: Automatic token refresh enables reliable scheduled executions
5. **Scalability**: Supports multiple client accounts per user

### Implementation Details

```python
# Fernet symmetric encryption for token storage
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Automatic token refresh service
# Runs every 10 minutes to refresh expiring tokens
# Uses exponential backoff for failed refresh attempts
```

### Security Measures

- **Token Encryption**: AES-256 Fernet encryption for stored tokens
- **Automatic Rotation**: 10-minute background service for token refresh  
- **Secure Storage**: Tokens stored in encrypted database columns
- **Access Logging**: All token operations logged for audit trails

## 2024-08-10: Frontend State Management Decision

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Frontend Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Frontend Team, Product Owner

### Decision

Use TanStack Query (React Query) v5 for server state management with React Context for client-side UI state.

### Context

RecomAMP requires complex server state synchronization for AMC query executions, real-time status updates, and optimistic UI updates. The application manages multiple data types: queries, executions, schedules, and instances with intricate relationships.

### Rationale

1. **Server State Specialization**: TanStack Query handles server state caching, synchronization, and background updates
2. **Real-time Updates**: Integrates seamlessly with Supabase real-time subscriptions
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Critical for responsive UI during long-running AMC queries
4. **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and debugging tools
5. **Performance**: Automatic background refetching and intelligent caching

### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Query key structure for consistent caching
const queryKeys = {
  workflows: ['workflows'] as const,
  workflow: (id: string) => ['workflows', id] as const,
  executions: (workflowId: string) => ['executions', workflowId] as const,
}

// Optimistic updates for immediate UI response
const executeWorkflowMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: executeWorkflow,
  onMutate: async (variables) => {
    // Cancel outgoing refetches
    await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['executions'] })
    
    // Snapshot previous value
    const previousExecutions = queryClient.getQueryData(['executions'])
    
    // Optimistically update
    queryClient.setQueryData(['executions'], old => [...old, optimisticExecution])
    
    return { previousExecutions }
  },
  onError: (err, variables, context) => {
    // Roll back on error
    queryClient.setQueryData(['executions'], context.previousExecutions)
  }
})
```

### Alternative Considered

- **Redux Toolkit**: Over-engineered for server state, requires significant boilerplate
- **SWR**: Good alternative but TanStack Query has superior TypeScript support and mutation handling
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL-focused, AMC APIs are REST-based

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Feature Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Designer, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement Build Guides as a structured content management system with markdown rendering and progress tracking rather than video-based tutorials.

### Context

Agency users need guided assistance for complex AMC query scenarios but have varying skill levels and learning preferences. The platform should provide self-service learning capabilities that reduce support requests and accelerate user onboarding.

### Rationale

1. **Content Flexibility**: Markdown allows rich formatting with tables, code blocks, and interactive elements
2. **Maintenance**: Text content easier to maintain and translate than video content
3. **Search & Index**: Text content can be searched and indexed effectively
4. **Version Control**: Markdown guides can be version controlled and reviewed
5. **Interactive Elements**: Can embed live SQL queries and sample data

## 2024-08-25: Schedule Execution Deduplication Decision

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Bug Fix / Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, DevOps, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement 5-minute deduplication window for schedule executions to prevent multiple concurrent runs of the same schedule.

### Context

The schedule executor service was triggering multiple executions for the same schedule due to race conditions in the background service polling. This caused duplicate AMC API calls, increased costs, and unreliable execution history.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Root Cause**: Schedule executor checked `next_run_at` time without accounting for currently running executions
2. **Race Condition**: Multiple service instances could pick up the same schedule simultaneously  
3. **Impact**: Duplicate executions, increased AMC API costs, confusing execution history
4. **Frequency**: Affecting ~10% of scheduled executions during peak times

### Solution Implementation

```python
# Modified schedule executor logic
async def should_execute_schedule(schedule: dict) -> bool:
    # Check if schedule has run within the last 5 minutes
    recent_runs = await self.get_recent_schedule_runs(
        schedule['id'], 
        minutes_ago=5
    )
    
    if recent_runs:
        logger.info(f"Schedule {schedule['schedule_id']} has recent runs, skipping")
        return False
        
    return datetime.now(timezone.utc) >= schedule['next_run_at']

# Immediate next_run_at update after execution trigger
async def execute_schedule(schedule: dict):
    # Calculate and update next_run_at immediately
    next_run = calculate_next_run(schedule['cron_expression'], schedule['timezone'])
    await self.update_schedule_next_run(schedule['id'], next_run)
    
    # Then proceed with execution
    await self.trigger_workflow_execution(schedule)
```

### Implementation Details

- **Deduplication Window**: 5 minutes prevents rapid re-execution
- **Immediate Updates**: `next_run_at` updated before execution to prevent race conditions
- **Logging**: Enhanced logging for debugging schedule execution issues
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing schedules continue working without migration

### Monitoring & Validation

- **Success Metric**: Reduce duplicate executions from 10% to <1%
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal additional database queries
- **Rollback Plan**: Disable deduplication check if issues arise

## 2024-08-26: Multi-Step Workflow Architecture Planning

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Planning
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, UX Designer

### Decision

Design Flow page as a visual workflow builder with DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution engine for multi-step AMC query workflows.

### Context

Agency analysts need to perform complex multi-step analyses that require chaining queries together, passing results between steps, and implementing conditional logic based on intermediate results. Current single-query execution limits analytical capabilities.

### Proposed Architecture

```typescript
interface WorkflowNode {
  id: string
  type: 'query' | 'transform' | 'condition' | 'merge'
  config: NodeConfig
  inputs: string[]   // Node IDs that feed into this node
  outputs: string[]  // Node IDs that this feeds into
}

interface WorkflowGraph {
  id: string
  nodes: WorkflowNode[]
  edges: WorkflowEdge[]
  variables: WorkflowVariable[]
}
```

### Technical Considerations

1. **Execution Engine**: Topological sort for dependency resolution
2. **Data Passing**: Temporary table creation for intermediate results
3. **Error Handling**: Partial failure recovery and retry logic
4. **Performance**: Parallel execution of independent branches
5. **UI Framework**: React Flow for visual workflow design

### Use Cases to Support

- **Attribution Analysis**: Campaign → Product → Customer journey queries
- **Audience Building**: Query → Filter → Export audience segments  
- **Performance Comparison**: Multiple date ranges → Merge → Calculate deltas
- **Competitive Analysis**: Multiple AMC instances → Normalize → Compare

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Simple linear workflows (A → B → C)
2. **Phase 2**: Conditional branching based on query results
3. **Phase 3**: Parallel execution and result merging
4. **Phase 4**: Template workflows for common use cases
