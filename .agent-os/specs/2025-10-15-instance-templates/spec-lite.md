# Spec Summary (Lite)

Create an instance-scoped SQL template system that allows users to save and reuse SQL queries specific to each AMC instance. This feature replaces the "Workflows" tab on instance detail pages with a "Templates" tab, providing a simpler alternative to the global query library for storing frequently-used queries without parameter management overhead. Templates are private to the user and scoped to specific instances, with one-click conversion to workflows for execution.
