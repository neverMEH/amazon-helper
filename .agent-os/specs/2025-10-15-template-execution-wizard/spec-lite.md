# Spec Summary (Lite)

Create a streamlined 4-step wizard that launches when users click "Use Template" on an Instance Template, enabling direct execution with both ad-hoc (run once with date range selection) and recurring schedule options. The wizard replaces the current navigation to Query Builder, providing immediate template execution with Snowflake integration and auto-generated descriptive workflow names based on instance brand, template name, and date range.
