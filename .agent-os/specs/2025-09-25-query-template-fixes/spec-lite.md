# Query Template Fixes - Lite Summary

Fix critical Query Library Template integration issues by properly connecting the existing CampaignSelector component for campaign parameters, implementing persistent template name visibility across all editor tabs, and integrating templates with Report Builder. These fixes will restore broken functionality where campaign selection uses basic text input instead of the sophisticated multi-select dropdown, resolve UX issues where template names disappear when switching tabs, and enable Report Builder users to access the full Query Library template collection.

## Key Points
- Connect existing CampaignSelector component for proper campaign parameter selection
