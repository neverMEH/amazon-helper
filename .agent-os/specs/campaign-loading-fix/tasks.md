## Tasks

- [ ] 1.4 Write test for empty campaigns list for new users

- [ ] 1.6 Verify all new tests fail initially (red state)

### 2. Implement Backend User Filtering
- [ ] 2.1 Modify `/api/campaigns/` endpoint in FastAPI to filter by authenticated user

- [ ] 2.5 Run backend tests to verify user filtering implementation (green state)

### 3. Write Frontend Tests for API Requests
- [ ] 3.1 Create or update frontend test file for campaign service
- [ ] 3.2 Write test to verify campaign API calls use trailing slash
- [ ] 3.3 Write test to verify campaign import API calls use trailing slash
- [ ] 3.4 Write test to mock successful campaign loading with proper endpoint
- [ ] 3.5 Verify all new frontend tests fail initially (red state)

### 4. Fix Frontend API Endpoint URLs
- [ ] 4.1 Update campaign service to use `/api/campaigns/` (with trailing slash)
- [ ] 4.2 Update campaign import service to use `/api/campaigns/import/{instance_id}/` if applicable

- [ ] 6.3 Update any relevant error messages to be user-friendly
- [ ] 6.4 Review and clean up any debugging code or console logs
- [ ] 6.5 Verify all tests pass in final state

### 7. Deployment Verification
- [ ] 7.1 Deploy to staging environment
