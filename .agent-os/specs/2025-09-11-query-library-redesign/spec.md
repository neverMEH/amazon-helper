# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Query Library Redesign
> Created: 2025-09-11
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the query library into a comprehensive, standalone feature that serves as the central hub for query templates with sophisticated parameter handling, seamless integration with workflows/collections/schedules, and automatic report generation. This will reduce query creation time by 50% and enable non-technical users to execute complex AMC queries through an intuitive interface.

## User Stories

### Query Template Management

As a data analyst, I want to create and manage reusable query templates with configurable parameters, so that I can standardize common analysis patterns across my organization.

Users can create query templates with dynamic parameters like ASINs, campaign IDs, and date ranges. The system auto-detects parameters from SQL, suggests appropriate input types, and provides validation rules. Templates can be versioned, forked, and shared publicly or privately within the organization.

### Bulk Parameter Input

As a campaign manager, I want to input large lists of ASINs (60+ items) and campaign IDs through bulk paste operations, so that I can analyze comprehensive product portfolios without manual entry.

The system provides a multi-select ASIN component with bulk paste support that validates ASIN formats, deduplicates entries, and handles lists of 100+ items efficiently. Users can paste from spreadsheets or text files, with automatic formatting and validation.

### Automated Report Generation

As a marketing director, I want query results to automatically generate interactive dashboards with appropriate visualizations, so that I can immediately understand insights without manual chart configuration.

When a template executes, the system maps result fields to appropriate widget types (funnel, metrics, charts) based on predefined configurations. Dashboards are generated with drag-drop layouts, real-time updates, and export capabilities to PDF/Excel.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced Query Templates System** - Comprehensive template management with versioning, forking, and sharing capabilities
2. **Sophisticated Parameter Framework** - Support for complex parameter types including bulk ASINs, campaign filters, dynamic dates, and thresholds
3. **Template-to-Dashboard Automation** - Automatic generation of interactive dashboards from query results with field mapping
4. **Seamless Integration Layer** - Native integration with workflows, collections, and schedules using templates as source
5. **Parameter Input Components** - Specialized UI components for different parameter types with validation and bulk operations

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaborative editing of templates
- External API integrations beyond AMC
- Machine learning-based query optimization
- Custom scripting languages for templates
- Template marketplace or monetization features

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional Query Library page at /query-library with template gallery, search, and category filtering
2. Template editor with Monaco SQL editor, live parameter detection, and test execution capabilities
3. Complete parameter input system supporting 60+ ASIN bulk paste, campaign selection, date ranges, and numeric thresholds
