## Implementation Order

### Critical Path
1. **Task 1.1, 1.2**: Analysis and preparation (required for all subsequent work)
2. **Task 2.1**: Update DataCollectionService (foundation for execution tracking)
3. **Task 2.2**: Update HistoricalCollectionService (completes the tracking flow)
4. **Task 3.1, 3.2**: Unit tests (validate individual components)
5. **Task 5.3**: Production validation (confirm working in live environment)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 can be done in parallel
- Task 4.1 can be done in parallel with Phase 3 testing
- Task 5.1 can be done in parallel with Phase 4 tasks

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Task 2.2 (core data collection logic)
  - Mitigation: Extensive testing in Task 3.2, careful error handling in Task 2.3
- **Medium Risk**: Production deployment
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive rollback plan in Task 5.2, careful validation in Task 5.3

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- All new data collection operations store execution_id in report_data_weeks
- Existing data collection functionality remains unaffected
- Test coverage >90% for all modified code
- No performance degradation >5% in data collection operations

### Business Success  
- Data analysts can trace collected data back to source executions
- System maintains complete data lineage for troubleshooting
- Zero data loss or corruption during implementation
- Seamless user experience with no service interruption

## Estimated Total Effort
- **Development**: 10 hours
- **Testing**: 7 hours  
- **Documentation/Deployment**: 2.5 hours
- **Monitoring/Analysis**: 3 hours
- **Total**: 22.5 hours (approximately 3 developer days)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- AMC API must continue returning execution_id in responses
- Supabase database must remain accessible during implementation
- No concurrent database schema changes to report_data_weeks table

### Internal Dependencies
- Historical collection service must be stable during testing
- Data collection background services should be paused during critical updates
- Access to production database for validation activities

### Assumptions
- execution_id column already exists in database (verified in Task 1.1)
- AMC API responses consistently include execution_id field
- No foreign key constraints currently exist that would block implementation
- Rollback to previous functionality is possible if needed
