# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Collection Execution View
> Created: 2025-09-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enable users to view detailed execution results for individual weeks from the collection progress screen. Users should be able to click on any week's execution to see the AMC execution details, query results, and metadata in the existing AMCExecutionDetail modal.

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to click on individual week executions in the collection progress screen to see their detailed results
- **As a user**, I want to view the SQL query, execution metadata, and results for any specific week execution
- **As a user**, I want visual feedback when hovering over clickable execution rows to know they're interactive
- **As a user**, I want proper handling when I click on pending or failed executions that don't have results yet

## Spec Scope

- Make execution IDs or week rows clickable in CollectionProgress component
- Open AMCExecutionDetail modal with proper instanceId and executionId parameters
- Handle null/empty execution_id cases (pending, running, or failed executions)
- Provide proper visual feedback for clickable vs non-clickable states
- Maintain existing modal state management patterns

## Out of Scope

- Creating new execution detail components (reuse existing AMCExecutionDetail)
- Modifying the collection execution backend logic
- Adding new API endpoints (use existing execution detail endpoint)
- Changing the collection progress data structure

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional clickable execution view feature where:
1. Users can click on completed executions to view details
2. Pending/running executions show appropriate disabled state
3. AMCExecutionDetail modal opens with correct parameters
4. Proper error handling for missing execution data
5. Consistent UI patterns with existing modal implementations
