## Overview

Implement a report dashboard system that enables queries from the query library to generate interactive visual reports with charts, graphs, and AI-powered insights. This feature bridges the gap between raw AMC query execution and actionable business intelligence by transforming query results into comprehensive dashboards with automated data visualization and analysis.

## User Stories

### Marketing Analyst Dashboard Creation

As a marketing analyst, I want to enable report generation for specific queries in my library, so that I can transform raw data into visual insights without manual data processing.

The workflow begins in the Query Library where I can toggle a "Enable Reports" checkbox on any query. When enabled, the query appears in the Reports Library section. I can then trigger historical data collection or wait for scheduled executions to populate data. Once data is available, I can open a detailed dashboard specific to that query type, viewing various charts, metrics, and AI-generated insights about campaign performance.

### Agency Account Manager Multi-Period Analysis

As an agency account manager, I want to compare performance metrics across different time periods and benchmark results, so that I can demonstrate value and identify optimization opportunities for clients.

After enabling reports for key queries and running historical data collection, I can access dashboards that automatically show period-over-period comparisons when multiple data windows are available. The system generates benchmarks, trend analysis, and highlights significant changes between periods. I can export these dashboards as PDFs with embedded charts and insights for client presentations.

### Campaign Optimizer Real-Time Monitoring

As a campaign optimizer, I want dashboards that update automatically with new execution data, so that I can monitor campaign performance continuously and make data-driven decisions quickly.

When scheduled workflows run or I manually execute queries with reports enabled, the corresponding dashboards automatically incorporate new data points. The visualizations refresh to show the latest metrics, funnel progressions update with current conversion rates, and AI insights adapt based on emerging patterns in the data.

## Spec Scope

1. **Query Library Integration** - Add "Enable Reports" checkbox to query templates and user workflows that signals report availability
2. **Reports Library Interface** - New section displaying all report-enabled queries with status, last update, and access to dashboards
3. **Dashboard Visualization Engine** - Interactive dashboard with multiple chart types (funnel, bar, line, pie, scatter) using Shadcn/Recharts components
4. **AI-Powered Insights Generation** - Automated analysis generating textual insights from dashboard data patterns and anomalies
5. **Export Functionality** - PDF and image export capabilities for dashboards with proper formatting and embedded visualizations

## Out of Scope

- Real-time data streaming (dashboards update on execution completion only)
- Dashboard sharing and permissions system (planned for future phase)
- Custom dashboard builder/editor interface
- Direct dashboard URL sharing without authentication
- Mobile-optimized dashboard layouts
- Dashboard templates marketplace

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional "Enable Reports" toggle in Query Library that persists the setting and shows report status
2. Working Reports Library page showing all report-enabled queries with ability to trigger historical data collection and open dashboards
3. Interactive 4-Stage Funnel dashboard implementation with all visualizations from the sample code, properly styled with Shadcn components
