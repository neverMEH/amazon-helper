# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Collection Report Dashboard
> Created: 2025-09-10
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive report dashboard integrated into the collections page that provides historical trending views, week-over-week comparisons, and multi-week analysis capabilities for KPIs and metrics from collection executions. This feature will transform raw collection data into actionable insights through interactive visualizations and flexible comparison tools.

## User Stories

### Analytics Manager Story

As an Analytics Manager, I want to view historical trends of my KPIs across all collection weeks, so that I can identify patterns, anomalies, and performance changes over time.

The user navigates to a completed collection and clicks "View Report Dashboard". They see a dashboard with multiple charts showing trending for each KPI column available in the collection results. They can hover over data points to see exact values, zoom into specific date ranges, and export charts for presentations.

### Campaign Optimization Story

As a Campaign Manager, I want to compare specific weeks against each other, so that I can understand the impact of campaign changes and optimizations.

The user selects Week 32 from a dropdown and sees all metrics isolated to that week. They then activate comparison mode and select Week 28 to compare against. The dashboard updates to show side-by-side comparisons with percentage changes highlighted. They can also select multiple consecutive weeks (Weeks 28-31) and compare them against another set (Weeks 32-35) to analyze the impact of a month-long campaign change.

### Executive Reporting Story

As an Executive, I want to see aggregated multi-week views and period-over-period comparisons, so that I can report on quarterly or monthly performance trends.

The user selects multiple weeks using a date range picker or checkbox selection. The dashboard aggregates the data and shows cumulative metrics. They can then compare Q1 weeks (1-13) against Q2 weeks (14-26) to see quarterly performance changes with clear visualizations of improvements or declines.

## Spec Scope

1. **Historical Trending Dashboard** - Interactive dashboard displaying time-series visualizations for all KPIs with configurable chart types and date ranges
2. **Single Week Isolation** - Ability to filter and view metrics for individual weeks with detailed breakdowns and drill-down capabilities  
3. **Week-to-Week Comparison** - Side-by-side comparison of two selected weeks with delta calculations and percentage change indicators
4. **Multi-Week Selection** - Capability to select and aggregate multiple weeks with sum/average/min/max calculations
5. **Multi-Period Comparison** - Compare aggregated periods (multiple weeks vs multiple weeks) with trending analysis

## Out of Scope

- Creating new AMC queries or modifying existing workflows
- Real-time data streaming or live updates during collection execution
- Exporting raw data to external BI tools
- Custom calculated metrics or KPI formulas beyond basic aggregations
- Predictive analytics or forecasting capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional report dashboard accessible from completed collections showing historical trending charts for all available KPIs
2. Interactive week selection controls allowing single week isolation, dual-week comparison, and multi-week range selection with immediate chart updates
3. Visual comparison indicators showing percentage changes, deltas, and trend directions when comparing periods
