# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-10-collection-report-dashboard/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-10
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Architecture

- **Report Dashboard Component** (`CollectionReportDashboard.tsx`)
  - Container component managing state and data fetching
  - Integration with existing `CollectionProgress.tsx` component
  - Lazy loading for performance optimization
  
- **Chart Components**
  - Extend existing chart components from `/src/components/charts/`
  - Support for multiple datasets per chart for comparisons
  - Interactive tooltips with detailed KPI information
  - Responsive design with Chart.js 4.5.0 configurations

- **Week Selection Controls**
  - `WeekSelector.tsx` - Single/multi-week selection component
  - `WeekRangePicker.tsx` - Date range selection for periods
  - `ComparisonToggle.tsx` - Enable/disable comparison mode
  - Integration with existing date handling using date-fns

- **Data Transformation Layer**
  - `CollectionDataTransformer` service for converting JSONB to Chart.js format
  - Aggregation utilities for multi-week calculations
  - Delta calculation for period comparisons
  - Caching strategy using TanStack Query

### Backend Services

- **Report Dashboard Service** (`report_dashboard_service.py`)
  - Extend `DatabaseService` base class
  - Methods for fetching and aggregating collection data
  - Efficient JSONB querying for KPI extraction
  - Support for various aggregation types (sum, average, min, max)

- **Data Processing Pipeline**
  - Parse `workflow_executions.result_rows` JSONB data
  - Dynamic column detection from `result_columns`
  - Time-series data formatting for frontend consumption
  - Memory-efficient processing for large datasets

### Performance Optimizations

- **Frontend Caching**
  - TanStack Query with 5-minute stale time for dashboard data
  - Memoization of chart configurations using React.memo
  - Virtual scrolling for large data tables
  - Debounced week selection to prevent excessive API calls

- **Backend Optimization**
  - Database query optimization with proper indexing
  - Pagination for large result sets (>10,000 rows)
  - Parallel processing for multi-week aggregations
  - Connection pooling with retry logic

- **Data Loading Strategy**
  - Initial load: Summary statistics only
  - Progressive loading: Detailed data on demand
  - Lazy loading: Charts render as they enter viewport
  - Background prefetching for adjacent weeks

### Chart Configuration Specifications

- **Line Charts** (Trending)
  - X-axis: Week dates with ISO week notation
  - Y-axis: Dynamic scaling based on metric range
  - Multiple series support for KPI comparison
  - Zoom and pan capabilities for large date ranges

- **Bar Charts** (Comparisons)
  - Grouped bars for week-to-week comparison
  - Stacked bars for component breakdown
  - Color coding for positive/negative changes
  - Data labels with formatting options

- **Heatmaps** (Multi-dimensional Analysis)
  - Week x Metric grid visualization
  - Color intensity based on metric values
  - Interactive cell selection for details
  - Export capability for reporting

### State Management

- **Dashboard State**
  - Selected weeks array
  - Comparison mode boolean
  - Active chart configurations
  - Filter and aggregation settings

- **Data State**
  - Cached collection data by week
  - Computed aggregations
  - Comparison calculations
  - Loading and error states

### Error Handling

- **Frontend Error Boundaries**
  - Graceful chart rendering failures
  - Fallback UI for missing data
  - Retry mechanisms for failed data fetches
  - User-friendly error messages

- **Backend Error Management**
  - JSONB parsing error handling
  - Missing data graceful degradation
  - AMC API error propagation
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Security Considerations

- **Data Access Control**
  - RLS enforcement for collection data
  - User-scoped queries only
  - No cross-user data leakage
  - Audit logging for data access

- **Input Validation**
  - Week selection boundary checking
  - SQL injection prevention in queries
  - XSS protection in chart rendering
  - Rate limiting for API endpoints
