# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: ASIN Management Page
> Created: 2025-08-27

## Overview

Implement an ASIN management page similar to the existing campaigns page that allows users to store, browse, and reference ASINs (Amazon Standard Identification Numbers) with their associated brand and metadata. This feature will enable users to quickly select and add ASINs to query parameters instead of manually looking them up, significantly improving workflow efficiency for AMC query creation.

## User Stories

### ASIN Data Import and Management

As an agency analyst, I want to import and manage a comprehensive list of ASINs with their associated brands and metadata, so that I can quickly reference them when building AMC queries without manual lookups.

The workflow involves:
1. Importing ASIN data from CSV files or manual entry
2. Viewing ASINs in a searchable, filterable table interface
3. Filtering ASINs by brand, marketplace, or other attributes
4. Selecting multiple ASINs to add to query parameters
5. Maintaining ASIN metadata for reference during analysis

### Query Parameter Integration

As a query builder, I want to select ASINs from the management page and automatically populate them into my AMC query parameters, so that I can build complex product-focused queries efficiently.

The workflow involves:
1. Creating or editing an AMC query
2. Clicking "Select ASINs" in the parameter configuration
3. Browsing and filtering the ASIN list by brand or attributes
4. Selecting desired ASINs with checkboxes
5. Having selected ASINs automatically populate the query parameter field

### Brand-Based ASIN Selection

As an account manager, I want to filter and select all ASINs for a specific brand at once, so that I can quickly create brand-wide performance reports without manually entering each ASIN.

The workflow involves:
1. Opening the ASIN selector in query parameters
2. Filtering by brand using a dropdown or search
3. Using "Select All" for filtered results
4. Confirming selection to add all brand ASINs to the query

## Spec Scope

1. **ASIN Data Table** - Paginated table displaying ASINs with columns for ASIN, Title, Brand, Marketplace, and other key metadata fields
2. **Import Functionality** - CSV upload capability to bulk import ASIN data with validation and duplicate detection
3. **Advanced Filtering** - Multi-field filtering including brand dropdown, marketplace selection, and text search across ASIN/title fields
4. **Query Parameter Integration** - Modal selector that integrates with query builder to populate ASIN parameters
5. **Performance Optimization** - Virtual scrolling for large datasets, server-side pagination, and caching for frequently accessed data

## Out of Scope

- Real-time sync with Amazon Catalog API (future enhancement)
- ASIN performance metrics integration (separate feature)
- Automated ASIN discovery from campaigns (future enhancement)
- ASIN-level permission management
- Export functionality (can be added later)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional ASIN management page accessible from main navigation with table view, filtering, and search capabilities
2. Working CSV import that validates data and handles duplicates appropriately
3. Seamless integration with query builder parameter fields allowing ASIN selection from the management page
