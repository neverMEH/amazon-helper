# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AMC Reports & Analytics Platform
> Created: 2025-09-05

## Overview

Build an advanced reporting and analytics platform that transforms AMC workflow executions into interactive dashboards with historical trend analysis, automated data collection, and AI-powered insights. This platform will provide comprehensive data visualization capabilities, automated weekly updates with intelligent data merging, and conversational AI interface for exploring business insights across multiple AMC instances and time periods.

## User Stories

### Automated Historical Data Collection

As an Amazon advertiser, I want the platform to automatically collect and backfill 52 weeks of historical data from my AMC workflows, so that I can analyze long-term trends and performance patterns without manual data export and compilation.

The platform automatically executes workflows on a weekly schedule, intelligently merging new data with existing records while avoiding duplicates. It maintains data integrity across different time periods and handles schema changes gracefully. Users can track data collection progress and resolve any conflicts through an intuitive interface.

### Interactive Dashboard Creation

As a data analyst, I want to create custom dashboards with multiple visualization types (charts, tables, metrics cards) that dynamically update from my AMC data, so that I can monitor KPIs and share insights with stakeholders through a unified interface.

The platform provides a drag-and-drop dashboard builder with pre-configured templates for common AMC use cases. Users can customize visualizations, apply filters, set up alerts, and share dashboards with team members. All charts are interactive with drill-down capabilities and export options.

### AI-Powered Business Insights

As a marketing manager, I want an AI assistant that can analyze my AMC data and provide conversational insights about trends, anomalies, and optimization opportunities, so that I can make data-driven decisions quickly without extensive manual analysis.

The AI interface understands AMC metrics, campaign structures, and business context to provide intelligent answers to questions like "Why did ROAS drop last month?" or "Which campaigns are underperforming?" It can generate executive summaries, identify growth opportunities, and suggest optimization strategies based on historical patterns.
