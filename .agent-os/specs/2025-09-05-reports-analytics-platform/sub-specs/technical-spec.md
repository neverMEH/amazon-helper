### Data Pipeline Architecture

- **Scheduler Enhancement** - Extend existing croniter-based system for weekly data collection schedules
- **Data Transformation** - ETL processes for standardizing AMC data across different workflow types
- **Caching Layer** - Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed dashboard data
- **API Rate Limiting** - Enhanced rate limiting for AMC API calls during bulk data collection
- **Error Recovery** - Automatic retry mechanisms and manual intervention points for failed data collection

### Frontend Dashboard Builder

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface** - React DnD implementation for dashboard layout management
- **Widget Library** - Reusable chart components with configurable data sources and styling options
- **Filter System** - Dynamic filtering interface with date ranges, instance selection, and metric filtering
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-optimized dashboard viewing with touch-friendly interactions
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Multiple users can view and edit dashboards simultaneously

### Performance Optimization

- **Data Aggregation** - Pre-computed summary tables for common dashboard queries
- **Lazy Loading** - Progressive loading of dashboard widgets and historical data
- **Database Indexing** - Optimized indexes for time-series queries and dashboard filtering
- **Background Processing** - Async processing for resource-intensive operations like backfill and AI analysis
- **Connection Pooling** - Enhanced database connection management for high concurrent usage
