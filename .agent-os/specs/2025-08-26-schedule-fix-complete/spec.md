> Spec: Schedule Feature Complete Fix
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix all remaining issues with the workflow scheduling system to ensure reliable, single executions at scheduled times with proper error handling and recovery. This fix will eliminate duplicate executions, stuck schedules, and execution failures that occur only in scheduled mode.

## User Stories

### Schedule Reliability

As an agency team member, I want scheduled workflows to execute exactly once at the scheduled time, so that I can rely on automated reporting without manual intervention.

The workflow should: trigger at the scheduled time, execute once and only once, properly handle test runs without affecting the schedule, and recover gracefully from failures with appropriate retry logic.

### Scheduled Execution Success

As a user, I want scheduled executions to work identically to manual executions, so that I don't have to manually run workflows that should be automated.

Scheduled executions should use the same authentication, parameters, and instance configuration as manual runs, ensuring consistent success rates between manual and scheduled executions.

### Schedule Monitoring

As an operations team member, I want clear visibility into schedule execution status, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any issues.

The system should provide clear logs, execution history, error messages, and metrics about schedule performance and reliability.

## Spec Scope

1. **Duplicate Execution Prevention** - Ensure atomic schedule claiming prevents any possibility of multiple executions
2. **Test Run Handling** - Properly reset schedules after test runs without causing stuck states
3. **Execution Parity** - Fix parameter passing so scheduled executions work identically to manual ones
4. **Error Recovery** - Implement proper retry logic for transient failures only
5. **Monitoring Enhancement** - Add comprehensive logging and metrics for schedule debugging

## Out of Scope

- Schedule UI redesign or new features
- New scheduling frequencies or patterns
- Integration with external scheduling systems
- Historical data migration or cleanup

## Expected Deliverable

1. Schedules execute exactly once at their scheduled time with zero duplicates
2. Test runs complete successfully and don't affect regular schedule timing
3. Scheduled executions have the same success rate as manual executions
