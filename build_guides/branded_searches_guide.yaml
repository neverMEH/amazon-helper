notes: |
  This guide provides comprehensive analysis of ad-attributed branded searches
  for DSP campaigns. Remember that branded search data requires feature enablement
  and is not available retroactively. Cost values are in millicents and must be
  converted (divide by 100,000) for dollar amounts. The 14-day attribution window
  is standard and cannot be modified.
