- Both ad types should have advertised the same products during the same time period
- Both ad products should have been running for at least one week during the same time period
- Wait at least 14 full days after the query's end date (see section 2.6 for explanation)""",

The query returns:
- **exposure_group**: Sponsored Products only, Display only, or both
- **unique_reach**: Number of distinct users reached
- **users_that_purchased**: Count of unique users that purchased
- **purchases**: Total purchases

## 2.2 Tables Used

| Table | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `sponsored_ads_traffic` | Sponsored Products traffic data | Filter: `ad_product_type = 'sponsored_products'` |
| `dsp_impressions` | Display advertising impressions | Contains DSP campaign data |
| `amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time` | Purchase attribution data | Requires 14-day wait after query end date |

## 2.3 Query Configuration

**Important Updates Required:**
1. Replace placeholder Display campaign IDs: `(11111111111),(2222222222)`
2. Replace placeholder SP campaign names: `'SP_campaign_name1', 'SP_campaign_name2'`

Search for 'UPDATE' comments in the query to find these locations.

## 2.4 CFIDs Limitation

Customer Facing IDs (CFIDs) are not yet available for Sponsored Products. Use campaign names for filtering until CFIDs are available.

## 2.5 Time Considerations

- Query time depends on number of advertisers, traffic volume, and conversions
- Start with 1 day for testing, then expand to week/month
- Month-long queries may timeout for high-volume instances
- The AMC team is actively working on performance improvements

## 2.6 14-Day Attribution Window

Since the query uses `traffic_time` attributed table, wait at least 14 full days after the query's end date. 

**Example:** For November data (11/1-11/30), wait until 12/15 or later to run the query to capture all ad-attributed sales.""",

| **DISPLAY** | Users exposed to Display only (or both, but SP came after conversion) |
| **none** | Users who purchased without recorded impressions (ignore for insights) |

## 3.2 Metrics Defined

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|

Calculate what percentage of users were exposed to each ad type:

1. Sum total unique reach across all exposure groups
2. Calculate % reach = (group reach / total reach) Ã— 100

**Example Results:**

| Exposure Group | Unique Reach | % Reach |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| both | 201,820 | 6.63% |
| SP | 807,175 | 26.50% |
| DISPLAY | 2,036,761 | 66.87% |
| TOTAL | 3,045,756 | 100% |

## 4.2 Calculating Purchase Rates

For each exposure group: Purchase Rate = users_that_purchased / unique_reach

**Example Results:**

| Exposure Group | Unique Reach | Users That Purchased | Purchase Rate |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| both | 201,820 | 5,590 | 2.77% |
| SP | 807,175 | 8,680 | 1.08% |
| DISPLAY | 2,036,761 | 1,842 | 0.09% |

## 4.3 Multi-Channel Impact Analysis

Compare the 'both' group to single-channel groups:

- **vs SP only:** 2.77% / 1.08% = **2.56x more likely to purchase**
- **vs Display only:** 2.77% / 0.09% = **30.78x more likely to purchase**

These results demonstrate the powerful synergy when users are exposed to both advertising channels, with multi-channel exposure significantly outperforming single-channel exposure.""",

1. **Always wait 14+ days** after the query end date before running to ensure complete attribution data
2. **Start with small time windows** for testing (1 day) to validate query performance
3. **Filter out the 'none' exposure group** for insights as these represent unattributed purchases
4. **Use campaign names for Sponsored Products** until CFIDs are available
5. **Consider query performance** when selecting date ranges - high-volume instances may require shorter periods
6. **Document your campaign IDs** clearly for reproducibility
7. **Compare purchase rates** rather than absolute numbers for fair comparison across groups
8. **Consider seasonality** when interpreting results - run analysis across different time periods
9. **Monitor both reach and conversion** to understand the full funnel impact
10. **Use results to inform budget allocation** between channels based on incremental impact""",

### Reach Distribution
- **Display dominates reach** with 66.87% of users (2,036,761)
- **Sponsored Products** reaches 26.50% of users (807,175)
- **Multi-channel overlap** affects 6.63% of users (201,820)

### Purchase Rate Analysis
- **Multi-channel exposure (both):** 2.77% purchase rate (5,590 / 201,820)
- **SP only:** 1.08% purchase rate (8,680 / 807,175)
- **Display only:** 0.09% purchase rate (1,842 / 2,036,761)

### Multi-Channel Impact
Users exposed to both channels are:
- **2.56x more likely to purchase** than SP-only users
- **30.78x more likely to purchase** than Display-only users

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Increase multi-channel coordination** - The synergy effect is substantial
2. **Expand Display reach for SP campaigns** - Low overlap suggests opportunity
3. **Optimize Display targeting** - Single-channel Display has lowest conversion
4. **Budget reallocation** - Consider increasing investment in coordinated campaigns
5. **Sequential messaging** - Design Display to prime users for SP conversion""",
