This instructional query analyzes the performance of audience segments in driving conversions on Amazon. It compares targeted segments (those you specifically selected in your campaign) versus untargeted segments (users who saw your ads but weren't explicitly targeted) to help optimize your audience strategy.

### Benefits of Analyzing Audience Segment Performance

- **Identify High-Value Segments**: Discover which audience segments drive the most conversions and revenue
- **Optimize Targeting Strategy**: Understand whether targeted or untargeted segments perform better
- **Budget Allocation**: Allocate more budget to segments with higher conversion rates
- **Audience Expansion**: Find new segments to target based on untargeted performance
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare segment performance across campaigns

### Key Use Cases

1. **Segment Performance Analysis**: Evaluate which audience segments generate the highest purchase rates
2. **Targeted vs Untargeted Comparison**: Understand the value of your targeting strategy
3. **Cross-Campaign Analysis**: Compare segment performance across different campaigns
4. **ROI Optimization**: Focus spend on segments with the best return on investment
5. **Audience Discovery**: Identify high-performing untargeted segments for future campaigns"""

### Data Returned

This query returns a comprehensive view of audience segment performance including:
- Segment identification (ID and name)
- Impression metrics (total and matched)
- Reach metrics (unique users)
- Conversion metrics (users, purchases, units, revenue)
- Campaign context (advertiser and campaign details)

### Tables Used

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `dsp_impressions_by_user_segments` | User segments from DSP | user_id, segment_id, campaign_id |
| `dsp_impressions_by_matched_segments` | Matched/targeted segments | user_id, segment_id, campaign_id |
| `amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time` | Conversion events | user_id, purchase metrics |

### Required Updates

Before running this query, you must update the following:

1. **Campaign IDs** (Line marked with `-- UPDATE 1`):
   - Replace with your specific campaign IDs
   - Format: `('campaign_id_1', 'campaign_id_2', ...)`

2. **Date Range** (Lines marked with `-- UPDATE 2` and `-- UPDATE 3`):
   - Update start_date and end_date
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Consider 14-day conversion window

3. **Segment Filters** (Optional - Line marked with `-- UPDATE 4`):
   - Filter to specific segment types if needed
   - Example: `WHERE segment_name LIKE 'IM%'` for in-market segments

4. **Matched Filter** (Optional - Line marked with `-- UPDATE 5`):
   - Filter to only matched (1) or unmatched (0) segments
   - Remove WHERE clause to see both

### Performance Optimization Tips

- **Date Range**: Keep to 30-90 days for optimal performance
- **Campaign Selection**: Limit to 10-20 campaigns per query
- **Segment Filtering**: Use segment prefixes to reduce data volume
- **Aggregation**: Pre-aggregate in CTEs to improve join performance"""

### Matched vs Unmatched Segments

**Matched Segments (matched = 1)**:
- Segments you explicitly targeted in your campaign
- These users were intentionally reached based on your targeting strategy
- Higher impressions here indicate successful targeting execution

**Unmatched Segments (matched = 0)**:
- Users who saw your ads but weren't in your targeted segments
- Often reached through contextual targeting or broad reach
- Can reveal unexpected high-performing audiences

### How to Read the Results

1. **Impression Distribution**:
   - Compare `impressions` vs `matched_impressions`
   - High matched ratio = precise targeting
   - High unmatched ratio = broad reach beyond targeting

2. **Conversion Performance**:
   - Calculate purchase rate: `users_that_purchased / impression_reach`
   - Higher rates indicate more effective segments
   - Compare rates between matched and unmatched

3. **Revenue Impact**:
   - Look at `total_product_sales` for revenue contribution
   - Calculate revenue per user: `total_product_sales / users_that_purchased`
   - Identify segments with high average order values

### Important Notes About Data

‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Duplication Warning**:
- Users can belong to multiple segments
- Impressions may be counted multiple times across segments
- Sum of segment impressions may exceed campaign totals
- Focus on relative performance rather than absolute totals

üìä **Statistical Significance**:
- Segments with <100 impressions may not be statistically reliable
- Look for patterns across multiple campaigns
- Consider confidence intervals for small segments

üîÑ **Attribution Window**:
- Standard 14-day attribution window applies
- Purchases beyond this window won't be captured
- Consider seasonality and purchase cycles"""

### Identifying High-Performing Segments

Look for segments with:
- **High Purchase Rate** (>2% is typically strong)
- **High AOV** (above campaign average)
- **Low CPA** (if cost data available)
- **Consistent Performance** across time periods

**Action Items for High Performers**:
1. Increase bid multipliers for these segments
2. Create segment-specific creative
3. Expand budget allocation
4. Find similar segments to test
5. Use for lookalike audience seeds

### Identifying Low-Performing Segments

Watch for segments with:
- **Low Purchase Rate** (<0.5%)
- **High Impressions but Low Conversions**
- **Below-Average AOV**
- **Declining Performance** over time

**Optimization Strategies for Low Performers**:
1. Reduce bids or pause targeting
2. Test different creative messages
3. Narrow targeting with additional filters
4. Check frequency caps (may be oversaturated)
5. Evaluate product-market fit

### Optimization Recommendations

#### 1. Portfolio Approach

- **Growth Segments** (30-40% budget): Showing improvement, scaling potential
- **Test Segments** (10-20% budget): New segments, experimental targeting

#### 2. Matched vs Unmatched Strategy
If unmatched segments perform well:
- Consider broader targeting strategies
- Test contextual and behavioral targeting
- Reduce segment restrictions

If matched segments dominate:
- Double down on precision targeting
- Create more granular segments
- Test segment combinations

#### 3. Segment Combination Tactics
- **Layering**: Combine high-intent segments (e.g., IM + Brand Followers)
- **Exclusions**: Remove poor performers from broad campaigns
- **Sequential**: Target awareness ‚Üí consideration ‚Üí purchase segments

#### 4. Creative Optimization by Segment
- **In-Market**: Focus on competitive advantages and urgency
- **Lifestyle**: Emphasize brand values and lifestyle fit
