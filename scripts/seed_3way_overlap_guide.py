This instructional query analyzes the impact of running **Sponsored Products** together with **Streaming TV** (formerly OTT) and **Display advertising**. It helps you understand:

- How exposure to multiple ad types affects purchase rates
- The incremental reach and overlap between channels
- The effectiveness of full-funnel marketing strategies
- Optimal media mix for driving conversions

### What Makes This Analysis Powerful

This is an expansion of simpler 2-way overlap analyses, allowing you to measure the synergistic effects when customers are exposed to:
- Display only
- Streaming TV only  
- Sponsored Products only
- Any combination of two channels
- All three channels together

### Key Business Questions Answered

1. **What percentage of my audience sees multiple ad types?**
2. **How much more likely are users to purchase when exposed to all three channels?**
3. **Which channel combinations drive the highest conversion rates?**
4. **Is there diminishing returns or amplification when combining channels?**

## Requirements

### Required Data
- **DSP Display campaigns** with impression data
- **Streaming TV campaigns** (OTT) with impression data  
- **Sponsored Products campaigns** with impression data
- All three must advertise the **same products** during the **same time period**

### Timing Considerations
- Campaigns should run **concurrently for at least 1 week**
- Due to 14-day attribution window, **wait 14+ days after campaign end** to run analysis
- Example: For November campaign (11/1-11/30), run query on 12/15 or later"""

### Step 1: Identify Your Campaigns

Find your campaign IDs and names for each channel before updating the query.

### Step 2: Update the Query Template

The query has **3 UPDATE locations** to customize:

#### Location 1: P1 (Display) Campaign IDs
```sql
p1_ids AS -- P1 defined as Display
(
  SELECT campaign_id
  FROM (
    VALUES
      (111122222),  -- Replace with your Display campaign IDs
      (333344444)
  ) AS b(campaign_id)
)
```

#### Location 2: P2 (Streaming TV) Campaign IDs
```sql
p2_ids AS -- P2 defined as Streaming TV
(
  SELECT campaign_id
  FROM (
    VALUES
      (555566666),  -- Replace with your Streaming TV campaign IDs
      (777788888)
  ) AS b(campaign_id)
)
```

#### Location 3: P3 (Sponsored Products) Campaign Names
```sql
p3_ids AS -- P3 defined as Sponsored Products
(
  SELECT campaign
  FROM (
    VALUES
      ('SP_BrandName_ProductLine_2024'),  -- Replace with exact campaign names
      ('SP_BrandName_ASIN_Group_Q4')
  ) AS b(campaign)
)
```

### Step 3: Run and Validate

1. Set appropriate date range in AMC
2. Verify 14+ days have passed since campaign end
3. Run the query and export results
4. Validate data quality"""

### Base Metrics from Query

|--------|-------------|----------|
| **impression_reach** | Unique users exposed to ads | Measure channel reach |
| **users_that_purchased** | Unique purchasers | Conversion counting |
| **purchases** | Total purchase events | Volume analysis |
| **sales** | Total revenue | Financial impact |

### Calculated Metrics

#### Purchase Rate
```
Purchase Rate = (users_that_purchased / impression_reach) × 100
```

#### Reach Distribution
```
% Reach = (impression_reach per group / total impression_reach) × 100
```

#### Lift Analysis
```
Lift = Purchase Rate (multi-channel) / Purchase Rate (single channel)
```

## Key Calculations Example

Using sample data:
- **All three channels**: 3.91% purchase rate
- **Display only**: 1.20% purchase rate
- **Streaming TV only**: 1.88% purchase rate
- **Sponsored Products only**: 1.80% purchase rate

**Lift Analysis:**
- 3-channel vs 1-channel average: **2.4x lift**
- 2-channel vs 1-channel average: **1.43x lift**"""

| Ad Types | Purchase Rate | Index vs Single |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 3 types | 3.91% | 260 |
| 2 types | 2.53% | 169 |
| 1 type | 1.50% | 100 |

**Strategic Implications:**
- **2.6x higher conversion** for users seeing all three channels
- **1.7x higher conversion** for two-channel exposure
- Clear incremental value from multi-channel approach

### Actionable Recommendations

#### Scenario 1: Low Three-Channel Overlap (<1%)
**Action Items:**
1. Increase frequency caps to enable more overlap
2. Use retargeting to expose single-channel users to other channels
3. Implement sequential messaging strategies

#### Scenario 2: High Single-Channel Concentration (>70%)
**Actions:**
1. Diversify media mix
2. Implement unified frequency management
3. Test incremental budget allocation to drive overlap

#### Scenario 3: Strong Two-Channel Performance
**Actions:**
1. Identify best-performing pairs
2. Allocate budget to proven combinations
3. Develop channel-specific sequential strategies"""

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] Ensure all campaigns target same products/ASINs
- [ ] Align campaign flight dates across channels
- [ ] Set appropriate frequency caps
- [ ] Document campaign IDs and names
- [ ] Verify impression data flowing

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: High "None" Group Percentage
**Symptoms**: >10% of purchasers in "none" exposure group

**Solutions:**
1. Extend lookback window
2. Check data completeness
3. Verify tracking implementation

### Issue: No Sponsored Products Data
**Symptoms**: Zero or very low p3 exposure

**Solutions:**
1. Use exact campaign names (case-sensitive)
2. Check date range overlap
3. Verify ad_group_type filter

### Issue: Unexpected Purchase Rates
**Common Reasons:**
- Different attribution windows
- Brand halo included/excluded
- Time zone differences
- Data freshness variations

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- Cost per acquisition by exposure group
- ROAS by channel combination
- Incremental reach percentage
- Conversion rate lift from overlap"""
