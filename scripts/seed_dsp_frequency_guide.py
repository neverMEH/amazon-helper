This instructional query helps you determine the **optimal impression frequency** for your DSP campaigns by analyzing the relationship between ad exposure frequency and various conversion metrics. It answers critical questions about campaign efficiency and audience saturation.

### Key Business Questions Answered

1. **What is the optimal frequency cap** I should apply based on my KPIs?
2. **What percentage of impressions** are delivered to users in each frequency bucket?
3. **Would increasing frequency** translate to increased performance?
4. **Where is the point of diminishing returns** for ad exposure?
5. **Am I underexposing or overexposing** my audience?

### Why Frequency Analysis Matters

Frequency optimization can significantly impact campaign performance:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Avoid wasting budget on overexposed users
- **Reach Maximization**: Reallocate budget from high-frequency to new users
- **Performance Optimization**: Find the sweet spot between awareness and annoyance
- **Customer Experience**: Prevent ad fatigue while ensuring message retention

### Common Frequency Patterns

#### 1. Underexposure Pattern
- Majority of users in frequency_01 bucket
- Low overall conversion rates
- Opportunity to increase frequency caps

#### 2. Optimal Distribution
- Bell curve distribution across frequency buckets
- Clear performance peak at specific frequency
- Efficient budget utilization

#### 3. Overexposure Pattern
- Heavy concentration in high frequency buckets
- Flattening or declining performance
- Need for frequency capping

## Requirements

### Required:
- Active DSP campaigns during the analysis period
- Sufficient impression volume for statistical significance
- Conversion tracking properly configured

### Recommended:
- At least 30 days of campaign data
- Minimum 100,000 impressions
- Multiple campaigns for cross-campaign analysis"""

### Frequency Buckets Explained

Frequency buckets group users based on how many times they've seen your ads:

| Bucket | Definition | Typical Use |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| frequency_01 | Seen ad 1 time | Light exposure |
| frequency_02 | Seen ad 2 times | Minimal repetition |
| frequency_03-05 | Seen ad 3-5 times | Moderate exposure |
| frequency_06-10 | Seen ad 6-10 times | High exposure |
| frequency_11-24 | Seen ad 11-24 times | Very high exposure |
| frequency_25+ | Seen ad 25+ times | Excessive exposure |

### Key Metrics for Analysis

#### Volume Metrics
- **users_in_bucket**: Unique users at each frequency level
- **impressions_in_bucket**: Total impressions per frequency
- **reach_percentage**: % of total reach in each bucket

#### Performance Metrics
- **purchases**: Number of conversions per frequency
- **purchase_rate**: Conversion rate by frequency
- **product_sales**: Revenue generated per frequency
- **add_to_cart**: Mid-funnel actions
- **detail_page_view**: Upper-funnel engagement

### Analysis Approaches

#### 1. Cross-Campaign Analysis
- Aggregates all specified campaigns
- Provides overall frequency optimization
- Best for portfolio-level decisions

#### 2. Per-Campaign Analysis
- Individual campaign frequency patterns
- Identifies campaign-specific optimizations
- Useful for differentiated strategies

### Identifying Optimal Frequency

#### Method 1: Peak Performance
Look for the frequency bucket with highest purchase rate:
- In example: frequency_06-10 at 0.12%
- Set frequency cap at upper bound (10)

#### Method 2: Diminishing Returns
Find where marginal benefit drops below 50%:
- Calculate improvement between buckets
- Identify where growth slows significantly
- Set cap just after this point

#### Method 3: Cost Efficiency
Calculate cost per incremental conversion:
- Compare additional impressions to additional conversions
- Find point where cost exceeds acceptable threshold
- Optimize for efficiency

### Common Scenarios and Solutions

#### Scenario 1: No Clear Peak
**Pattern**: Flat or continuously rising performance
**Solution**: 
- Test higher frequency caps
- May indicate strong message-market fit
- Consider budget/reach tradeoff

#### Scenario 2: Early Peak and Decline
**Pattern**: Performance drops after frequency_03-04
**Solution**:
- Implement strict frequency cap at peak
- Refresh creative more frequently
- Check for audience fatigue

#### Scenario 3: Bimodal Distribution
**Pattern**: Peaks at low and high frequency
**Solution**:
- Likely different audience segments
- Segment analysis recommended
- Differentiated frequency strategies

## Action Planning Template

Based on your frequency analysis:

### If Underexposed (>60% at frequency_01):
1. Week 1: Increase frequency cap to 2x current
2. Week 2: Monitor performance change
3. Week 3: Adjust based on results
4. Week 4: Test optimal frequency identified

### If Optimally Distributed:
1. Maintain current frequency settings
2. Test +/- 1 frequency level
3. Monitor for seasonal changes
4. Document as best practice

### If Overexposed (>10% at frequency_15+):
1. Immediately implement frequency cap
2. Exclude recent converters
3. Refresh creative assets
4. Reallocate budget to new audiences"""

### Setting Frequency Caps

#### DSP Frequency Cap Options

| Cap Type | Setting | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Daily | 2-3 impressions | High-frequency products |
| Weekly | 7-10 impressions | Standard campaigns |
| Monthly | 20-30 impressions | Long consideration cycles |
| Lifetime | 50+ impressions | Brand awareness campaigns |

#### Implementation Best Practices

1. **Gradual Adjustment**
   - Don't jump from no cap to strict cap
   - Reduce by 25% increments
   - Monitor performance at each level

2. **Segment-Specific Caps**
   - New customers: Higher frequency
   - Retargeting: Lower frequency
   - Cart abandoners: Medium frequency

3. **Creative Rotation**
   - Rotate every 3-5 exposures
   - Prevents message fatigue
   - Maintains engagement

### Advanced Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Dayparting with Frequency
```sql
-- Analyze frequency performance by hour of day
SELECT
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM impression_time) AS hour_of_day,
  frequency_bucket,
  AVG(purchase_rate) AS avg_purchase_rate
FROM
  frequency_analysis
GROUP BY
  1, 2
```

Optimize delivery times based on when each frequency performs best.

#### 2. Cross-Device Frequency Management
- Account for multi-device exposure
- Implement household-level frequency caps
- Consider mobile vs. desktop patterns

#### 3. Sequential Messaging
Map creative sequence to frequency:
- Frequency 1-2: Awareness message
- Frequency 3-5: Consideration content
- Frequency 6+: Conversion focus

### Budget Reallocation Strategy

#### Calculate Wasted Impressions
```sql
-- Identify wasted impressions beyond optimal frequency
WITH optimal_frequency AS (
  SELECT 10 AS optimal_cap  -- Based on analysis
),
wasted AS (
  SELECT
    SUM(CASE 
      WHEN user_impressions > (SELECT optimal_cap FROM optimal_frequency)
      THEN user_impressions - (SELECT optimal_cap FROM optimal_frequency)
      ELSE 0
    END) AS wasted_impressions,
    SUM(user_impressions) AS total_impressions
  FROM
    user_impression_counts
)
SELECT
  wasted_impressions,
  total_impressions,
  ROUND(100.0 * wasted_impressions / total_impressions, 2) AS waste_percentage,
  wasted_impressions * avg_cpm / 1000 AS wasted_spend
FROM
  wasted
  CROSS JOIN (SELECT AVG(cpm) AS avg_cpm FROM campaign_metrics)
```

#### Reallocation Opportunities
1. **Reach Extension**: Use saved budget to reach new users
2. **Channel Diversification**: Invest in other ad products
3. **Creative Development**: Improve message quality
4. **Audience Testing**: Explore new segments

### Monitoring and Iteration

#### Weekly Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] Check frequency distribution changes
- [ ] Monitor conversion rate by frequency
- [ ] Review waste percentage
- [ ] Analyze new vs. returning user frequency
- [ ] Validate cap effectiveness

#### Monthly Optimization Cycle
1. **Week 1**: Gather data and run analysis
2. **Week 2**: Identify optimization opportunities
3. **Week 3**: Implement changes
4. **Week 4**: Monitor and document results

### Frequency Strategy by Campaign Type

#### Brand Awareness Campaigns
- **Goal**: Maximum reach with minimum frequency
- **Target**: 3-5 exposures per user
- **Cap**: Weekly cap of 5-7
- **Focus**: Reach over frequency

#### Consideration Campaigns
- **Goal**: Balanced frequency for engagement
- **Target**: 5-10 exposures per user
- **Cap**: Weekly cap of 10-12
- **Focus**: Engagement metrics

#### Conversion Campaigns
- **Goal**: Optimal frequency for purchase
- **Target**: Based on analysis (often 7-15)
- **Cap**: Match to optimal point
- **Focus**: Conversion rate and ROAS

#### Retargeting Campaigns
- **Goal**: Remind without annoying
- **Target**: 3-7 exposures
- **Cap**: Strict daily cap of 2-3
- **Focus**: Recency over frequency
